- Git status: !`git status --porcelain`

**Process:**

2. Analyze staged diff to understand all changes
3. Generate conventional commit message documenting ALL changes

- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`
- Body: Document ALL changes with bullet points, wrap at 72 chars
